## Introduction

This is a simple Online Learing site for Programming Languages designed using Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JS for front-end, MySQL for database creation and PHP for back-end. The user can Sign Up/ Login and start learning whenever he wants. This site has an admin panel for better control of the database and users. I have used the phpmyadmin for creating and storing of my database.
